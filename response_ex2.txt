Introducing the B2B sales process...
It's Monday morning...
"Ah, good," you say to yourself. "Time to sit back and relax."...said no account exec, ever!
The best AEs know that if they want that meeting to succeed, then they have to get to work straight away. They have to improve their knowledge. They have to get to know their prospect better. They have to follow a process...
But what is that process?...We asked our business development team for their insights. How do they manage the hard job of B2B sales, from researching prospects to conducting demos and closing business?

They gave us their answers...and then we put them all together in this eBook. 

We know that time is money in B2B sales, so we'll stop wasting yours. 

Prepare yourself for the best biz dev guide you'll read this year. 

Strap yourselves in, we're ready to launch! 

Why should you follow a B2B sales process? 

Most salespeople enjoy the freedom that comes with their role. The ability to bring their personality to every demo and adapt to changing conversations. 

However, the best salespeople aren't artists - they're scientists. They use B2B data to form insights and optimize their work. 

A B2B sales process provides a framework upon which a salesperson can improvised while providing four additional benefits: 

1. Having a more rigid process in place makes it easier for new starters to get up to date. 

Breaking a sales strategy into stages makes it easier to identify aspects that aren't working and adjust them. 

3.


Seeing where customers are in the sales process makes it easier to forecast more accurately.
Having a more structured sales approach makes it impossible to overlook important steps.

The 8 stages of the B2B sales process

What does the B2B sales process look like for Cognism's AEs? These are the 8 stages they follow:

Fed back Research Wup Ollow F Discovery Closing Objection handling Demonstration

Now it's time for the good stuff - let's explore each of the 8 stages in detail.

1 - Research
Here's a frightening statistic:

86% of B2B buyers say they see "no real difference between suppliers."

With so much choice available to customers, it's more important than ever for AEs/BDMs to make a genuine connection with prospects and clearly display how their product can help change their lives.

Through research, before running a demo, is your route to achieving this.

This research phase can help determine whether product is good fit for buyer. Follow 3 steps: connect with prospect company, read up industry news LinkedIn, and create list of technology company uses. Make note of recent events/milestones to build rapport demo.

With this knowledge, you will sound like an expert in their field - helping you to build trust with the prospect.

Demos conducted without discovery are 73% less successful than demos conducted with.
Salespeople who tie their demos to specific pain points are 35% more likely to win a deal.
So, now you know how important discovery is. But what is it?
The purpose of discovery is to uncover your prospect’s existing processes and any pain points they may have. The idea is to start a conversation with them and identify exactly how your product can fit into their current workflow and improve it.

The discovery phase can be conducted either over an exploratory "discovery call" before the demo is scheduled, or in the early stage of the demo itself. 

If possible, we recommend having a discovery call with the prospect, separate from the demo. Our business development team shared the following steps:
Step 1 - Identify goals
The company's short-term and long-term sales strategy goals.
The prospect's individual goals.
Ask the prospect questions that reveal this information. Their answers will be your basis for further discovery. Keep them in mind as the call progresses. How will your product help the prospect and their company achieve these goals?
"It's important to be precise. Focus on metrics and get percentages if possible. Establish quantity. For example, you can ask a question like: how much are you looking to increase your net new bookings? Then you can tie the prospect's answers to the results that your product can deliver."

Step 2 - Identify pain points
The prospect has investigated your company because they have business challenges they want to overcome.
 For some, the pain they're feeling may be hard to define. Guess what? It's the salesperson's role during the discovery call to explain their pain! The best way of doing this is to ask open-ended questions about the prospect and their business. Get the prospect talking more and they'll soon realize what their own pain points are. Open-ended questions are questions that don't require a simple "yes or no" answer. Here are some examples, straight from the Cognism sales playbook: What was the reason for you joining me on this call today? What prompted you to explore our solution? How big is your 222 team? What are your core KPIs? Have you used a data provider before? If so, was it successful and why? What are the goals that your company is working towards? What's the biggest challenge your company is facing right now? What's prevented you from relieving this pain? What does success look like for your business? What technologies does your team currently use?

What CRM do you use?

What's the average sales cycle at your company?

What's the relationship like between sales and marketing?

Are you the decision-maker on a project like this?

The B2B Sales Process Handbook - 10

"Identify 2-3 pain points that the prospect is experiencing. Check with them afterwards if you've understood correctly. Focus on the prospect's tech stack - chances are, there's a gap there that your product can fill."

Nancy Newman Associate Sales Director, Cognism

Step 3 - Tie everything together

This is the fun part!

Take the 2-3 pain points you've unearthed and connect them to a specific feature of your product. Now you've got a short list of features that you can explain to the prospect.

Show them how the features will produce benefits - linking the benefits to the goals you identified in Step 1. Tying everything together in this way will help you build up a strong business case.

"Don't go through every one of your product's features."


The prospect is only interested in the parts that are relevant to them and their business.

William Gay, Business Development Manager, Cognism

Step 4 - Recap and reaffirm

At the end of each stage of your discovery call, repeat what you've learned back to the prospect. Ask them if what you've discovered is correct.

Trust us, it's far from a pointless exercise - doing this means that they might divulge even more information that will help you!

"When your discovery call comes to an end, recommend the next step but let the prospect decide. It could be a follow-up email or going straight into booking a product demo. Always set exact timings for whatever the next step will be."

Brahm Jagpal, Business Development Manager, Cognism

"If you're conducting the call online (which is likely considering recent global events!), always make sure the video is on! Being able to see each other will help you build rapport much quicker."

Jonathan Ilett, Sales Director, Cognism

3 - Qualification

After discovering more about the prospect, it's time to qualify them.

Are they ready to buy from you - yes or no?

Similar to discovery, this stage can be conducted on a separate sales call, or as part of the demo process.
What is qualification?
It's the process of evaluating whether a prospect is a good fit for your product or service. At the end of this stage, you should be in a position to judge if the prospect is ready to progress to a demo or pitch.
Why is qualification important?
You know as well as we do - all salespeople are fighting against the clock. You've got targets to hit and a finite amount of time in which to hit them. You don't want to be wasting your time on a prospect that isn't a serious contender for making a purchase. This is why qualification is important - it saves you time and means that you can quickly see if the prospect is a good candidate to be progressed to the demo stage.
How can you qualify correctly?
At Cognism, we teach our biz dev team to qualify new leads according to the BANT criteria:
Budget Authority Is the prospect willing and able to spend the ultimate amount?
 All of the questions our BDMs ask during qualification are based around these 4 areas. Use open-ended questions to get the prospect talking. These are questions that don’t elicit a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response. They help to get a conversation going. The more information you get from the prospect, the easier it is to qualify them. Sample questions include: What does your current sales strategy look like? How does your sales team generate new leads? Who would normally be involved in buying decisions for new tech? What tools are you currently using? What regions are you looking to prospect into? What competitors have you investigated in the past? What did you like about them? What did you dislike? What are your current business growth goals? Are you in a position to take on new clients right now?

Never close a client that you know you won’t be able to deliver to. Bradley Davies, Business Development Manager at Cognism, says that the demonstration stage is crucial in the B2B sales process. He recommends structuring the demo to last between 30 and 45 minutes and having a clear agenda to keep the conversation focused. The goal is to present the product in a way that satisfies and alleviates the prospect's pain, creating a single narrative that showcases how the product can solve the prospect's problem. During the demo, it's important to take notes to capture any feedback or objections raised by the prospect.

If you don't, you will forget key points!

Cognism's BDMs use this template for their demo note-taking. Adapt it for your own company's needs/USP.

Company overview: Brief description of the prospect's company, its industry, and size. Ideal customer profile: The industries and job titles that the prospect's company targets. Current process: How the prospect's company generates new business. Tech stack: The main tools used by the prospect's team. Key hook: What are they looking to get out of using the product? Rapport: Personalized notes/information that could be useful in follow-ups.

Introduction and rapport: While the introduction and rapport sections should be short and sweet, they are still important. While you want to focus on getting to the next stage quickly, you need to build your narrative straight from the kick-off. It's not about making a sale; it's about selling a future state. Think back to the 3 steps from the Research stage. What did you find out about your prospect?

Have they recently won an award, for example, or been featured in an industry publication? Use the intel you have on them to build rapport.
Mirroring is a great technique for rapport-building. It’s often taught to cold callers but can be just as effective for AEs. Here’s how it works: Listen carefully to how the prospect speaks and the words they use. Then, imitate the way they talk, using the same words or phrases. Mirroring is a great technique for rapport-building. It’s often taught to cold callers but can be just as effective for AEs. Here’s how it works: This tactic has been proven to increase the odds of being “accepted” by the person you’re talking to. It relaxes the prospect and makes them feel more comfortable talking to you.
On a demo, you should ideally be speaking for 40% of the time, while the prospect speaks for 60%. If you’re having difficulty getting your prospect to speak, don’t be afraid to use pauses! They’re a great technique for getting the prospect to talk more.

Agenda: Set a flow or expectation of what you intend to discuss next. 📅

5 - Objection handling.
At this stage of the B2B sales process, you'll start demonstrating some product features. Naturally, the prospect will have some objections.

As we mentioned earlier, Cognism uses the BANT methodology to qualify leads. Most objections you'll encounter will also conform to the 4 pillars of BANT.

This is how you handle them.

Budget - "I don't have the money to buy."

First, find out more about the reasons behind the objection.

Is it genuinely that the price is too high, or is it that the prospect doesn't see the value of your product for the price they'll have to pay?

If it's that the price is too high, emphasize the value of your product or what makes you different from the competition.

If they don't see the value, explain how your product will change their life for the better!

This could be anything from saving them time or money, or helping them generate leads and revenue. You have to give the prospect a compelling reason to buy from you.
A compelling reason needn't necessarily be based around pricing or cost. It could be anything from certain product features, the level of customer service that your company provides, or customer reviews.
Don't discount...
After all that, if the prospect still has an objection... try to avoid the temptation of going straight to discounting. Doing this can all too quickly devalue your product. If the prospect has a pricing objection, there are other things you can suggest instead of taking money off.
Perhaps consider bespoke payment terms that help spread the cost of investment, without reducing the overall price.
Use case studies and testimonials...
Another strategy for resolving a pricing issue is to bring up some of your company's success stories. Prove that other organizations are achieving results with your platform and that the expenditure is worth it.

Mention some satisfied customers who work in the same industry as your prospect (this is a very important point - whatever customers you mention, they must be relevant to the prospect). Always have some suitable case studies and testimonials to hand during your demos. Authority - "I'll have to speak to my boss about this before deciding." To handle this objection, start by confirming what the prospect's concerns are. Maybe you can provide some information that will stop them from referring their query upwards. If you play this right, you can turn the prospect into a champion for your product. They can help you get the buy-in you'll need from the ultimate decision maker. The B2B Sales Process Handbook - 21. If that doesn't work, and a third party has to be involved, stay calm. Simply arrange a time to speak with them and book it in your diary. Need - "We really don't need your product right now." With this objection, you need to get to the root of the problem.
 What’s stopping them from buying? It may be that the prospect loves certain product features, but not others. It may be that they just can't see (yet!) how your product will help them. Two things will assist you here: data and content. Data Provide the prospect with some data that displays the difference your product can make. We recommend pulling 2-3 stats or facts to use on your demo. Before using them, check that the stats you've chosen are relevant to the prospect's industry or business. Content Make use of the materials produced by your marketing team (if you have one!). Come prepared to the demo with a couple of appropriate customer case studies. If the prospect has a couple of very specific questions, maybe you can direct them to a blog or two on your company website.

If you're encountering objections that your company's content can't solve, suggest scheduling a regular meeting between sales and marketing. Share ideas with the marketing team to produce content that moves the needle.

Timing - "It's not the right time for us to buy."

Handle this objection by creating a sense of urgency. Remind the prospect of the costs of not buying your product now, using the research and information gained during the early stages of the process. Turn the objection on its head by using Cognism's business development playbook scenarios:

Scenario 1: The prospect's company is launching a new product or initiative.
Action: Your product can help them achieve their goals.

Scenario 2: The prospect's company has recently acquired funding.

Your product is a wise investment and can take their business to the next level.

The prospect has only recently joined the company. Your product can help them achieve great results and make a big impression early on.

The prospect’s company had a bad quarter. Your product will help them turn their fortunes around.

The prospect has to wait for an incoming hire with ultimate decision-making power. Your product will enable the decision-maker to become even better at their job once they arrive.

Key takeaway:
The trick is to turn each disadvantage into an advantage.

The bottom line is - investgate each objection, ask searching questions, uncover the reason behind each one - and then use the information to handle them effectively.

“My number one objection handling tip? Answer the prospect’s most urgent objection first.”
“The reason for this is, once you’ve resolved that, it makes answering all the other, less troublesome objections much easier.”
 You’ve shown that you can be trusted and it will make the prospect feel much more certain that you have the solutions they’re looking for. 67 That you have the solutions they’re looking for.”  

Jonathan Ilett  
Sales Director, Cognism  

 You’ve demonstrated the value of your product, handled all of their objections, and convinced the prospect that your solution is an investment which can’t be passed up on. Offering some free added value to the deal can help get it over the line.  Discuss prices and negotiate if necessary. Confirm if there are any other stakeholders who need to sign-off on the deal. This will ensure that there are no surprising bumps along the way. Now the signed contract is in sight! “If there are other stakeholders involved in the decision, and other hoops (legal, IT or procurement etc.), talk about them at this point.” “But above all, get the prospect excited.

Make them look forward to using your product.  After all, you’ve just shown them how it will make their problems disappear!

7 - Follow up

Congratulations! You’ve just signed a new customer. But wait - the B2B sales process isn’t over quite yet…

Start formatting your demo notes. Include all the key points you discussed and the agreed next steps. Arrange your notes in a way that works for you and makes it easy to scan for important information.

Then, your next task is to compose a follow-up email. The message should document everything you and the prospect discussed:

* How much you enjoyed showing them your product - keep building that rapport, even at this stage!
* The key points of what you talked about (if possible, include a recording of your demo).
* Clear and concise next steps and timelines for completion.


Include any extra information at the end of the email.

The B2B Sales Process Handbook / 26

“Write your follow-up as if it’s going to be read by multiple people. Chances are, it will - on average, there are 7 people involved in any B2B buying decision!”

“Make it clear, detailed, well-thought-out and professionally written (no grammar errors, no typos).”

Alex Shorthose
US Senior Business Development Manager, Cognism

8 - Feedback

This is the final step in the B2B sales process, and it happens after the prospect becomes a customer.

Give your new customer some time to get to grips with your product and see the value of it. Then, check in with them and ask them for their feedback.

This is the post-sales questionnaire that our BDMs send to new clients:

Which words would you use to describe our product?

How well does our product meet your needs?

Which 3 features are the most valuable to you?

What are the 3 most important features we’re missing?

If you could change just one thing about our product, what would it be?
How would you rate the value for money of our product?
The B2B Sales Process Handbook - 27
How did using our product compare to your expectations?
Compar ed to our competitors, is our product better, worse, or about the same?
Why did you choose our product rather than a competitor’s?
On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to others?
What would you say to someone who asked about us?
The insights you gain from customer feedback can impact four key areas of the business:
Improving the sales process - it demonstrates which features are highly prized by customers.
Sharpening marketing messaging - it gives the marketing team fresh insights into how the product is perceived.
Proposing product upgrades - it highlights which features need to be enhanced or revamped.
Establishing industry positioning - it gives you a much better idea of where your business sits in the market.
